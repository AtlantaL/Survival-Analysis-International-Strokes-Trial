**Authors:** Atlanta Liu, Maruthi Mutnuri

**Date:** Winter 2020

This report contains a statistical analysis on survival rates for patients who are suffering from symptoms of ischemic stroke. The goal is to find which medication (heparin or aspirin) improves overall survivability the most over the course of the 6-month period from randomization. The entire project was completed in RStudio. Below is a general list of the procedures we followed in our analysis.

### Procedures

- Kaplan-Meier Survival Curve
- Log Rank Test
- Cox Proportional Hazards Modelling
- Testing Model Assumptions and Goodness of Fit:
  - Proportional Hazards Test
  - Linearity of Covariates
  - Influential Outliers
- Time Splitting Data
- Hazard Ratio Interpretations

### Kaplan-Meier Curve (Heparin vs Aspirin)
